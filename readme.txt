Transform standard WordPress galleries into galleria slideshows. 

== Description ==

<<<<<<< HEAD
Galleria Galleria is a fork of [Photo Galleria](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/photo-galleria/) that is designed to minimize resources and selectively load javascript. I love how the Photo Galleria plugin was integrated into the Wordpress gallery system but I could not stand seeing so many resources load on every page when only one might contain a gallery. Galleria Galleria will only load javascript on pages that actually have a gallery. Beyond that, we will see what other improvements I can make to this plugin. I'm open for suggestions!


== Installation ==

1. Upload the entire `photo-galleria` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. All existing galleries inserted using the [gallery] shortcode will now use Galleria Galleria.

Galleria Galleria is a fork of [Photo Galleria](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/photo-galleria/) that is designed to minimize resources and selectively load javascript. This plugin will only load javascript on pages that actually have a gallery. Galleria Galleria also keeps standard gallery styling if javascript is not enabled.  Beyond that, this plugin is built using the [Galleria javascript library](http://galleria.aino.se/) that allows for advanced theming and customization.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How is this plugin different from other Wordpress gallery plugins? =
Galleria Galleria is designed to only selectively load javascript to reduce the load time of your site. It also works seamlessly with galleries you have already created for your site in Wordpress.

== Other Notes ==
This plugin uses the standard [gallery] shortcode to create slideshows. It also adds support for a per gallery height attribute in the format [gallery height=500] to create a gallery with a height of 500px.
