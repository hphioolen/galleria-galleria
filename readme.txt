Transform standard WordPress galleries into galleria slideshows. 

== Description ==

Galleria Galleria is a fork of [Photo Galleria](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/photo-galleria/) that is designed to minimize resources and selectively load javascript. I love how the Photo Galleria plugin was integrated into the Wordpress gallery system but I could not stand seeing so many resources load on every page when only one might contain a gallery. Galleria Galleria will only load javascript on pages that actually have a gallery. Beyond that, we will see what other improvements I can make to this plugin. I'm open for suggestions!


== Installation ==

1. Upload the entire `photo-galleria` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. All existing galleries inserted using the [gallery] shortcode will now use Galleria Galleria.
